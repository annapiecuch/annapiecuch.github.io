# Where do Undergrads Reside at Lehigh University?
Here is an infographic I created to display the percentage breakdown of Lehigh undergraduate students who live in Greek life houses, in residence halls, or off-campus in the fall of 2019, data courtesy of Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics. This data is eye-opening because the breakdown reveals that out of the large population involved in Greek life on campus, only small percentages of undergrads in fraternities or sororities actually reside in the Greek houses. These numbers also reveal that more undergrads live in residence halls than off-campus, which makes sense, because Lehigh mainly requires first years and sophomores to stay in their designated dorms. It is interesting, however, to see that undergrads living in residence halls outnumbered those living off-campus at Lehigh.
