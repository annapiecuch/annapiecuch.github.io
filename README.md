# Where do Undergrads Reside at Lehigh University?
Here is an infographic I created to display the percentage breakdown of Lehigh undergraduate students who live in Greek life houses, in residence halls, or off-campus in the fall of 2019, data courtesy of Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics. This data is eye-opening because the breakdown reveals that out of the large population involved in Greek life on campus, only small percentages of undergrads in fraternities or sororities actually reside in the Greek houses. These numbers also reveal that more undergrads live in residence halls than off-campus, which makes sense, because Lehigh mainly requires first years and sophomores to stay in their designated dorms. It is interesting, however, to see that undergrads living in residence halls outnumbered those living off-campus at Lehigh.

# What are the Most-Streamed Weekly Tracks on Spotify Worldwide?
Here, I made an infographic on Canva to convey the top number, in millions of streams, of songs globally each week on Spotify, as of February 10, 2022. The data provided by Statista shows readers how popular songs prove to be by how often they are streamed weekly, and it shows how songs from many years ago can still be timeless. Some new releases hit high volumes of streams because people love new music, such as Elton John and Dua Lipa's "Cold Heart," first released in August of 2021, but some songs just never get old, such as "Heat Waves," a song by Glass Animals that was first released in 2020. A key finding of this data, however, is that the majority of most-streamed songs weekly worldwide as of Feb. 10, 2022 are songs that were first released in 2021, so are not too old yet. To me, this means that songs that were released even up to three or five years ago, let alone any classics from other decades, are highly unlikely to appear on a list of top global streams on a weekly basis. Social media trends and influencer use of songs could change the course of this list, though. TikTok has proven that songs become viral from repeated use and exposure online, so it has a large influence on what songs become popular and make the radio in today's day in age. These trends in music popularity will have to be further studied to come to any generally agreed-upon conclusions.

# Disney Princess Movies: A Pre-2000s Timeline
The timeline displays time points that reflect when Disney's first major animated films about princesses, specifically, were first released. The first Disney movie of all time is a princess movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which came out in 1937. Major findings from the timeline reveal that The Little Mermaid, released in 1989, sparked a "Disney Renaissance" after a lull in Disney Studios film success. Princess movies tended to be a huge hit that helped Disney increase its revenue and build its company, as opposed to other themes and tropes used for their movies.

# Russia Ukraine War: Active Military Personnel According to Country
I chose this timely topic to depict in a column chart because it reveals the overwhelming support of NATO allies in the war effort during the Russian-Ukraine War, which unfolded on February 24, 2022. The humanitarian crisis of the Russia-Ukraine War began because Russian forces attacked Ukraine's major cities in an effort to occupy the country. As of March 8, 2022, there have been 516 civilian deaths in Ukraine. As of March 9, 2022, Poland had the highest number of refugees, hitting 1.3 million people, followed by Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. As of March 10, 2022, the chart reveals the military capacity of NATO allies, Russia and Ukraine in a comparison graph.

# Undergraduate Student Perentages for Each of Lehigh's Three Colleges
The chart below shows the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate schools in the last 5 years, ranging from 2017 to 2021. The college of Arts & Sciences has seen a slight increase in enrollment, according to the line chart, in the past 5 years, while the college of Engineering as seen a slight decline. The college of Business, however, has seen little change and remains stagnant.

# Self-Reported Life Satisfaction vs GDP per capita in 2017, per country
The chart below displays data from the World Happiness Report of 2019, revealing self-reported Life Satisfaction ratings associated with each GDP per capita (in thousands) as of 2017 in various countries. Afghanistan is the lowest point on the chart, falling at 1803.98749	GDP per capita and 2.66171813 rating of Life Satisfaction, while the farthest-to-the-right point on the chart is Luxembourg, which falls at 94277.9654 GDP per capita and has a Life Satisfaction rating of 7.06138086. There is a moderately-weak, positive correlation between GDP per capita in thousands and Life Satisfaction rating for the year of 2017 among a variety of countries. Many data points representing countries fall at about 40,000 GDP/capita, in the center of the chart, with Life Satisfaction ratings falling stagnant around ratings of a 6 or 7 for the right side of the scatterplot. This reveals that for every increase in GDP in thousands per capita, there is a slightly higher/greater change in Life Satisfaction ratings until after about 40,000 GDP per capita.

# NBA players' Weights (in lbs.) vs Shoe Size
The scatterplot below shows the association between NBA players' shoe sizes and their weights in pounds. There is a moderately-strong, positive correlation between shoe size and weight of players in the NBA. Trae Young, with a shoe size of 13, sticks out as a dot that falls outside of the general linear correlation because he is lighter in weight at 164 lbs, yet he has a shoe size of 13, higher than the two data points of Tony Parker and Kemba Walker at 11 and 11.5 shoe sizes.

# Global Violent Protests in the Past 2 Years
The map below reveals protests that escalated to high levels of violence from 2020 to 2022 across the globe. The reasons for these violent protests in diverse areas of the world vary drastically, ranging from police brutality, to military rule, to issues such as teacher pay. Recent violent protests that occurred in 2022 thus far include Belarus demonstrations in February, 2022, protesting the Russia-Ukraine war, and increasing fuel prices caused protests in Kazakhstan in January, 2022. Protests of 2020 centered upon elections and police brutality, largely. There are many, many more protests that occur globally each year, but these stand out because they share a feature of particularly dangerous violence involvement that pose more of a threat to civilians' safety and well-being.

# Party Locations Most Likely for Lehigh Students to Attend, Based on Group Affiliation

The charts labeled below depict the party locations that Lehigh students are more likely to go to, based on their involvement in a group on campus. On the left, you see the percentages of responding Lehigh students in accordance with which location for parties that they would be more likely to attend, and on the right, the number of students who responded according to group affiliation reveal which location they are more likely to attend. I found it most interesting to see that Greek life members responded with the most enthusiasm when stating they would be more likely to party in a Greek house, while other groups said they would be more likely to attend a party off campus.

# Growth Rate Percentages of Median Income According to Country, from late 2000s to 2021, and Global Extreme Poverty Statistics

The data story highlights growth rate percentages from the late 2000s to 2021 according to country worldwide, as the data source World Bank works to accumulate knowledge of shared prosperity and working to boost the income growth of the bottom 40 percent of each country's welfare distribution. Dates in which countries compare median income to see growth rates vary, as some range from 2006 to 2011, some chosen time frames stretch from 2012 to 2017. Therefore, countries' time frames of comparison do not align, unfortunately, but separate databases were collected and combined by World Bank to compare many areas of the world. As a result, we have estimated the percentage rates of income growth by labeling the maps as ranging from the late 2000s to today. Extreme poverty rates are also reflected at the end of the data story, showing that Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa see some of the largest growing poverty rates across the world as of 2021. This data shows what areas we should provide aid to, due to extreme poverty beingmost prominent and a pressing issue that threatens the livelihood of a nation's citizens. Extreme Poverty statistics are courtesy of https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty, and WorldBank.org provides the data on measured shared prosperity/ median incomes.
