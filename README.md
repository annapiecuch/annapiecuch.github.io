# Where do Undergrads Reside at Lehigh University?
Here is an infographic I created to display the percentage breakdown of Lehigh undergraduate students who live in Greek life houses, in residence halls, or off-campus in the fall of 2019, data courtesy of Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics. This data is eye-opening because the breakdown reveals that out of the large population involved in Greek life on campus, only small percentages of undergrads in fraternities or sororities actually reside in the Greek houses. These numbers also reveal that more undergrads live in residence halls than off-campus, which makes sense, because Lehigh mainly requires first years and sophomores to stay in their designated dorms. It is interesting, however, to see that undergrads living in residence halls outnumbered those living off-campus at Lehigh.

# What are the Most-Streamed Weekly Tracks on Spotify Worldwide?
Here, I made an infographic on Canva to convey the top number, in millions of streams, of songs globally each week on Spotify, as of February 10, 2022. The data provided by Statista shows readers how popular songs prove to be by how often they are streamed weekly, and it shows how songs from many years ago can still be timeless. Some new releases hit high volumes of streams because people love new music, such as Elton John and Dua Lipa's "Cold Heart," first released in August of 2021, but some songs just never get old, such as "Heat Waves," a song by Glass Animals that was first released in 2020. A key finding of this data, however, is that the majority of most-streamed songs weekly worldwide as of Feb. 10, 2022 are songs that were first released in 2021, so are not too old yet. To me, this means that songs that were released even up to three or five years ago, let alone any classics from other decades, are highly unlikely to appear on a list of top global streams on a weekly basis. Social media trends and influencer use of songs could change the course of this list, though. TikTok has proven that songs become viral from repeated use and exposure online, so it has a large influence on what songs become popular and make the radio in today's day in age. These trends in music popularity will have to be further studied to come to any generally agreed-upon conclusions.

# Disney Princess Movies: A Pre-2000s Timeline
The timeline displays time points that reflect when Disney's first major animated films about princesses, specifically, were first released. The first Disney movie of all time is a princess movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which came out in 1937. Major findings from the timeline reveal that The Little Mermaid, released in 1989, sparked a "Disney Renaissance" after a lull in Disney Studios film success. Princess movies tended to be a huge hit that helped Disney increase its revenue and build its company, as opposed to other themes and tropes used for their movies.

# Russia Ukraine War: Active Military Personnel According to Country
I chose this timely topic to depict in a column chart because it reveals the overwhelming support of NATO allies in the war effort during the Russian-Ukraine War, which unfolded on February 24, 2022. The humanitarian crisis of the Russia-Ukraine War began because Russian forces attacked Ukraine's major cities in an effort to occupy the country. As of March 8, 2022, there have been 516 civilian deaths in Ukraine. As of March 9, 2022, Poland had the highest number of refugees, hitting 1.3 million people, followed by Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. As of March 10, 2022, the chart reveals the military capacity of NATO allies, Russia and Ukraine in a comparison graph.
